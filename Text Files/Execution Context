# EXECUTION CONTEXT
#
# python uses top down approach
#
# GLOBAL FRAME
# all of your code lives here
#
# FUNCTION FRAME
# temporary and only exists while function is being run
#
# MUTABLE vs IMMUTABLE
#
# in execution context ints are seen as immutable and are not stored as references ...
# ... this means that changing it within a function context will not work
#
# Lists are held in a different context form global ...
# this means when you try to call a list you are calling the reference to the list object instead of the list object itself ...
# this makes it accessible within funcition context
